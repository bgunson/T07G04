As it stands our game is one player. After placing your ships you will be promted to choose a shot location agaisnts your own ships. The game ends when all the placed ships have been destroyed. We will be working to implement a computer player and work towards our GUI version in the coming weeks.

To run the game compile and execute the files in the src folder:

  javac *.java
  
  java StartProgram

Note: The keyboard input does not have error checking for correctly ranged input nor format of the input.
  - When prompted to place a ship, coord location is in form "a 4" which must have a space between the char and int.
